# Assessment : Palindrome
A palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

Implement the function so that it must take one word or sequence and return `True` if the input is a palindrome, otherwise `False`.

# Example
Find some palindrome bellow: 
- madam
- nurses run

<!-- ```python
``` -->

# TODO
Implement the logic of the solution in the file named `file.py`.

Add a clear and concise docmentation to the `solution function` and `main function`.

Add logic the `solution function` and `main function`.

**NB**: If you think you need other arguments to better define the `solution function` add these arguments only using `**kwargs`.
